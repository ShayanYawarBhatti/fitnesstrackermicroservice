### A. For which teammate did you implement “Microservice A”?
Implemented for: Rylie Shaniyo

---

### B. What is the current status of the microservice?
The microservice is complete and fully functional. It has been tested with a client script.

---

### C. If the microservice isn’t done, which parts aren’t done and when will they be done?
N/A – The entire microservice is implemented.

---

### D. How is your teammate going to access your microservice?
They should:
1. Clone the GitHub repository (provide the link here if needed)
2. Run `pip install flask`
3. Start the service using: `python microservice_a.py`

It will run locally at: `http://localhost:5000`

---

### E. If your teammate cannot access/call your microservice, what should they do?
They should immediately message me on Discord. I will be available to troubleshoot any issues.

---

### F. By when do they need to inform you?
Please inform me by **August 8th, 2025** so we can resolve the issue before integration deadlines.

---

### G. Is there anything else your teammate needs to know?
- The microservice uses in-memory data, so it resets every time you restart the server.
- Ensure the date format is `MM/DD/YYYY`
- Duration should be an integer (minutes)
- Use Python’s `requests` library to send and receive data
